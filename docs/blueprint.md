## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7), drawing from the color of the amethysts found in Kenya, signifying wisdom, dignity, independence, creativity, mystery, and magic. 
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), a low saturation hue similar to the primary to avoid drawing focus from the data, while creating a light mode visual.
- Accent color: Vibrant orange (#FF9800), an analogous hue that contrasts well against the background and the primary color for highlighting important elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif font with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look for a data heavy interface. 
- Use simple, clear icons to represent data types and functions, ensuring they are distinct and easily understandable.
- Prioritize a clean and uncluttered layout, focusing on critical information and real-time feedback, using concise labels and tooltips.
- Incorporate subtle animations for data updates and transitions, providing real-time feedback without being distracting.
